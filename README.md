# React Native FlatList Inconsistent Empty List Rendering

This repository demonstrates a bug where a FlatList in React Native inconsistently renders an empty list, even when data is fetched successfully from an API.  The issue appears to be intermittent, working correctly sometimes but failing others without apparent changes to the code or environment.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the app on an iOS or Android emulator or device.
3. Observe that the FlatList sometimes displays the fetched data and sometimes shows an empty list.

## Potential Causes

* **Asynchronous Operations:** The timing of data updates might be causing rendering inconsistencies.
* **State Management:** An issue with how the component state is updated and managed might lead to missed updates.
* **React Native's internal rendering mechanisms:**  A possible bug within React Native's handling of FlatList updates.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the FlatList re-renders reliably whenever the data changes.  This might involve using techniques such as keys, refreshing the FlatList explicitly, or reviewing data transformations to avoid subtle inconsistencies.
